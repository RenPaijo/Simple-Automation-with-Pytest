## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

        git clone <repository-url>
        cd <repository-folder>

2.  **Install dependencies:**

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **Run the tests:**

        pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html

## Viewing the Test Report

After running the tests, a file named `report.html` will be generated. This file contains a detailed report of the test results. Here's how to open it:

1.  **Locate the `report.html` file:**
    *   It should be in the root directory of your project (the same directory as this `README.md` file).

2.  **Open the file in your web browser:**
    *   **Double-click** the `report.html` file. This should open it in your default web browser.
    *   Alternatively, you can **right-click** the file and select "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

3.  **View the report:**
    *   The `report.html` file will display a summary of your test results, including:
        *   The number of tests run, passed, and failed.
        *   Detailed information about each test case, including any error messages or screenshots.
        *   Environment information and other relevant details.

## Key Learning Points

-   Setting up **Selenium WebDriver** for automation.
-   Writing clean, maintainable test scripts using **Pytest**.
-   Organizing tests and reusable components for better scalability.
-   Generating detailed test reports for analysis.
